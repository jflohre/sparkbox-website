  <p>Our convictions drive our work, and they affect how we accept projects and build client relationships. Our work tends to look like this:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Consultation, Education, or Implementation</dt>
      <dd>Our projects take one of three forms:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>We consult:</strong> providing direction to your team as they execute on projects.</li> 
          <li><strong>We educate:</strong> teaching teams big and small about our areas of expertise.</li> 
          <li><strong>We implement:</strong> building beautiful, powerful websites and web applications.</li>
        </ul>      
      </dd>
    <dt>Honesty and Experience</dt>
      <dd>Honesty is our default gear. We've been doing this for a long time, and we've unfortunately seen others make a lot of bad decisions. Our goal is to make our clients' projects successful, and if it takes a little bit of tough love and brutal honesty, we're willing to say what needs to be said. But don't worry. We're nice about it.</dd>  
    <dt>Hourly Work</dt>
      <dd>We've found that fixed-price projects don't serve our clients &mdash; or us &mdash; very well. Client and we are unfortunately pitted in a duel attempting to gain the most from the other within limited resources. This rarely benefits the project, and it doesn't allow us to have the positive client relationships we desire. Instead, we prefer to work hourly. We're glad to be paid only for the work we've done.</dd>
      <dd>Our rate for implementation is currently $165/hr, consultation is $200/hr, and educational engagements are situationally priced at request.</dd>
    <dt>Initial Engagements</dt>
      <dd>Every project has a life cycle. The most challenging and confusing phase is its birth. With a relatively small initial contract, we've found we can gain an immense amount of knowledge and perspective on new projects. We can then produce really useful initial planning, project scope, and resource estimates.</dd>
      <dd>Our clients also have no further obligation with us after an initial engagement. They can take this knowledge and implement elsewhere if they choose. Should they decide to continue working with us, we are in an infinitely better place to begin work.</dd>
    <dt>New Processes and Deliverables</dt>
      <dd>We do our best to work in a way that makes good use of our clients' budgets and our time. Seeking the most efficient means for a project can lead to unorthodox process and unique deliverables. This is something we ask our clients to be comfortable with. We'll help you understand why we do what we do, and we think you'll enjoy the fresh outlook.</dd>
