  <p>Don't feel obligated, but if you'd like to kickstart our relationship, we'd love to have you complete the below form. If we work together, these are the sorts of questions we'll ask eventually. They are useful for us to know in order to serve you well, and they are a useful exercise for you as well.</p>
